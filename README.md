# Pong Game
A classic pong game against an AI opponent. Here are some key points about the game:
- The game is never ending, it does not stop.
- Your opponent is grumpy, it gets angry when it loses so watch out!
- The game is played in the space near a black hole, if a round takes longer, the platform keeps getting closer to the black out and hence the ball gains extra momentum.
